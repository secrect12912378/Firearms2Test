Major major changes for Firearms!

Besides my XML overhaul, this is probably the biggest update I've done to date. SO many new and exciting things! So many drastic changes!
First and foremost. Guns, can NOT be permiently researched anymore. You can not invest points into learning how to craft these guns. That system, is gone the way of the dinosaur!
You may have noticed Schematics in the last update. Allowing you to find individual guns and ammo around the world to learn independently. Well, that system got a bit of an overhaul.
Schematics are no longer a "find and use to learn" tool. They are now, well, schematics and how they function IRL. Like a book! Can't expect to make something awesome without following the steps, now can we?
So thats how blueprints, as I call them, behave. Equipt the blueprint, go up to the respective workbench, and all knowledge will be unlocked! But, sounds kinda annoying right? What if I want my SCAR at level 50? Now I have to go and FIND the damn
book? RNG sucks! I'm never lucky! Well, these Blueprints, can also be created by you, at ANY time. The ONLY requirement gate, is the original firearm. Find the gun, get a few scrap (custom materials), and blamo! You can now create the Bleuprint
so that you may continue to craft it in the future!
This new system, will allow the looters of the groups, to bring home those hard earned bounties, and not have it go exclusively to ONE player. You don't have to sacrifice points anymore towards a certain skill tree, no being forced to use those 
precious 3 and 4 points to force yourself to hit Skill 8 or 9 just to craft something. This hopefully frees the players up a bit to experience more of other mod projects, while not having to sacrifice anything to enjoy a few things that go bang ;)

Our next amazing change, thanks to the great Xyth, is ACTUAL SCRAPPABLE ITEMS! Yes, that crafting window spammed with everything is now gone! No more taking guns and ammo home just for the sake of ripping it apart. You can now scrap guns and ammo 
on the go! This also fixed the bug where ammo wouldn't return when scrapping via the bench. Thankfully, this new system will return your ammo. So feel free to spam S all you want on those guns! They won't turn into Mechanical parts anymore!

Major UI changes to workbenchs and gun Modification windows.
My level 6 weapons now have 12 mod slots, so a bit of a UI overhaul was in order to make it not look like a hot pile of garbage. Assembly window, sadly, is the ONLY thing that will carry over to the original game and other peoples works. Sadly,
I was not able to create my own like I did with the others. Hope you find them enjoyable and pleasing! All UI mods work with and without bigger backpack UI mods (including S420's and my own).

MODS MODS AND MORE MODS!!!!!!!!!
Lotsssssss of gun mods. And some long awaited ones!
- Hair Sight, x1, x2 and x4 versions
- Acog x2 version
- DOT scopes now come in 1.2x zoom native.

Attachments, these things are friggin awesome. I put physical Bayonets, Hand Grips, Silencers, Lasers (not working all that great, hard to pull off without scripting), 
We also have (non rendering mods) a Banana Clip (x2 mag) Drum Mag (x5 mag) Quick Mag (also known as a Dual Mag, giving 1.5x reload speeds) and a special mod, the Block Buster. Expensive, but allows you to do some serious heavy damage to blocks
(it basically acts like the current Dev gun, but not a 1 shot destroy). 

2 New guns, and 1 new item you'll all love
- High Tech Rifle, aka Alien Ray Gun. This is a very very powerful piece of tech. It will obliterate anything in its path (and everything around it). This thing was soooo much fun to make. I had a blast playing with it.
- FLAME THROWER!!!!!!!! So many of you wanted this, and I had to do it justice. Xyth helped me big time on this one, so many many thanks to him and letting me annoy his discord PM's for help :P This badboy is a lot of fun. It'll ignite anything it
touches, and everything around it. And boy is it BRIGHT! 

- Grass Bomb. This grenade bomb fits inside the Minilauncher, and will allow you to clear chunks of land of grass and rocks with ease. Sadly, it'll do a little little bit of damage to the ground. So if you are planning to farm, make sure you have some
dirt around for repairs. Very minimal damage, but it'll stop you from upgrading the land (does like 3 dmg to the ground). This also may lag slightly upon impact for some users. So be aware. This is JUST FOR GRASS. Does absolutely zero damage to zombies
and it'll just lag you out and probably get you killed. It's a home item, not a combat item.

Reskinned all the workbenches, and some of the guns.
